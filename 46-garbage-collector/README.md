I did not took this class. 
But I found idea interesting.
I had only access to webpage of assignmnet,
  but do not have access to any link or material
  or source code.
So I asked gpt to generate the code based on,
   this idea. Which seems to clear how it works.
But this code does not work.
May be I will implement it in future.
